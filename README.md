# Abelian Sandpiles

![40x40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84873060-28bd-4567-98b2-79d841414b65)

## Capabilities
This code can
* Carry out operations on abelian sandpiles and display them
* Find the identities of MxN sandpile groups using 2 different methods (sounds complicated, but looks very pretty!!)

## Sources
My primary source for information on sandpiles comes from [this bachelor's thesis](https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/21391/1/bMath_2020_DomanN.pdf) and the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model), as a lot of information on this topic is behind academic paywalls.

## Downsides
Either due to being written in Python or I am a bad programmer, it becomes infeasible on my computer to calculate identities past 40x40. This makes me want to rewrite the program in a faster language, which I may very well do.
